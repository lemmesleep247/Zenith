## Installation Guide

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2.1) or a newer version.
3. Ensure Android SDK 33+ is installed.
4. Build and run on a physical device (recommended for proper permission handling).

## Required Permissions

To help you stay focused and break mindless habits, Zenith needs a few permissions.

### Required
Without these, Zenith won't be able to track your usage or help you stay mindful.

1. **Usage Stats (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`)**: This lets Zenith see how much time you spend in your apps so it can help you stick to your limits.
2. **System Overlay (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`)**: This allows Zenith to show a "Shield" or a timer over other apps when you've reached your limit or need a mindful pause.
   - **Note for Android Go users**: Some Android Go devices do not allow granting this permission through settings. You may need to grant it via ADB:
     `adb shell pm grant com.etrisad.zenith android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
3. **App List (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`)**: Zenith needs this to show you a list of your apps so you can choose which ones you want to track or block.
4. **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`)**: Used to send you goal reminders and keep you updated on your focus progress throughout the day.
5. **Do Not Disturb (`ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY`)**: This allows Bedtime Mode to automatically silence your phone so you can get a better night's sleep.
6. **Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`)**: Required for the AppUsageMonitorService that continuously tracks your app usage, and for alarm playback.
7. **Full Screen Intent (`USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`)**: Allows Zenith to show full-screen overlays for alarms and goal reminders over the lock screen.
8. **Wake Lock (`WAKE_LOCK`)**: Keeps the screen on during alarm display so you can see and dismiss it.
9. **Boot Completed (`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`)**: Restarts Zenith's monitoring services and re-schedules alarms after your device reboots.

### Optional
These are optional, but they make Zenith much more reliable and powerful.

10. **Accessibility Service (`BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`)**: An optional service that helps Zenith catch when you open a restricted app instantly, making your "Shields" feel much more responsive.
11. **Notification Intercept (`BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE`)**: This lets Zenith hide distracting notifications during your scheduled Focus sessions or Bedtime.
12. **Battery Optimization**: This tells Android not to close Zenith in the background, ensuring your focus time is always tracked accurately.
13. **Precise Timing (`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`)**: Makes sure your daily resets, bedtime schedules, and reminders happen exactly when they're supposed to.
14. **Storage Access (`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`)**: Only used if you want to use the Backup & Restore feature to save or load your settings.
15. **Internet Access (`INTERNET`)**: Used to check for app updates (depending on where you downloaded the app) and to let you visit our GitHub or community pages from the settings.
16. **Calendar Access (`READ_CALENDAR`)**: Enables the "Show Current Event" feature, which displays your current calendar event (title, description, and progress) during the app-opening delay in the intercept overlay.
17. **Camera (`CAMERA`)**: Only needed if you use QR Scan tasks in Pause Point, so you can scan one of your saved QR codes to continue. You can grant it from Settings > Features > Pause Point > QR Scan, or from the permission sheet under Optional Service.
